# Running Unit Tests

You can use PyTest to automatically run all the test in the test directory. 
For development, you will need to install the package to a vitual environment and then register the path to the source code.
Read [how to register the package locally](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/goodpractices.html) in the Pytest documentation.
